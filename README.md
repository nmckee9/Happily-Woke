# Happily Woke

## Description

A minimalist news application, using vader-sentiment analysis to filter news headlines based on the mood. You can start by checking the mood you are feeling or which type of news you would like to see (positive, neutral, or negative). The page will then filter and display headline news according to the checked mood. You can also search for articles on any desired topic. You have the abilty to save articles to your "saved page" for future reading and reference.

The following image shows a glimpse of the application:
